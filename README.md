# This webpage was created to display ability to program in
# JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was also used to house some
# of the other assignments that were completed during this
# course. It is not a live website.

# HOME PAGE: a site displaying my information, such as interests,
# programming languages with which I have experience and links to
# 2 projects: assignment 1 and 2, a link to one of my favorite books
# and one of my favorite movies.

# ASSIGNMENT 1: a page that changes the text color and background
# based on user selections. The text is pulled from the plot summary
# of one of my favorite movies: Zelig by filmmaker Woody Allen.

# ASSIGNMENT 2: allows a user to add and delete table rows. Also,
# has a function to rearrange the content found in the rows based
# on length of the text.
